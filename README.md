# pytrk - A Minimal Version Control System (Like Git, but Simpler)

**pytrk** is a lightweight, educational version control system written in Python â€” built from scratch to help understand how Git works under the hood.

Inspired by the internals of Git, `pytrk` provides core version control features such as commits, branches, diffs, logs, and checkouts, using a custom object database and reference system.

This is a side project I built to deeply understand how Git works internally. If you're interested in learning how Git functions under the hood, Check out my blog: https://gitinternals.hashnode.dev/how-does-git-work-internally â€” it will walk you through the codebase and help you build something like this yourself.
